<p>This is (going to be) a blog by Ricky_Lili, a master candidate of CS (NLP as major) in Sichuan University, a potential indie developer, an eternal learner.</p>

<h3>Upcoming:</h3>
<p>* A blog, not about tech and code, but some abstract things, some writer stuff.</p>
<p>* Some ideas about applications. One called "WeaWords", a combination of "weave" and "words". Have a guess! What does it do?</p>
<br/>
<p>Running with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.</p>
