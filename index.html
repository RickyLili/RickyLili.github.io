This is (going to be) a blog by Ricky_Lili, a master candidate of CS (NLP as major) in Sichuan University, a potential indie developer, an eternal learner.

Upcoming:
* A blog, not about tech and code, but some abstract things, some writer stuff.
* Some ideas about applications. One called "WeaWords", a combination of "weave" and "words". Have a guess! What does it do?
